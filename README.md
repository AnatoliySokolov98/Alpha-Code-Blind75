# Blind75
LeetCode Blind 75 Problems in TypeScript

the blind75 folder contains all of the TypeScript files for each problem.
the js-files folder contains all of the TypeScript files in the project converted to JS.

npm start will convert all ts files to js and run the leetcode.problem.js file.


npm run build will convert all of the ts files to js files.


npm run dev will run the leetcode-problem.ts without converting anything

ex.

or you can do install ts-node and run:
